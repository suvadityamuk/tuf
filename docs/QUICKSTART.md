# Quickstart #

In this quickstart tutorial, we'll use the basic TUF command-line interface
(CLI), which includes the `repo.py` script and the `client.py` script, to set
up a repository with an update and metadata about that update, then download
and verify that update as a client.

Unlike the underlying TUF modules that the CLI uses, the CLI itself is a bit
bare-bones.  Using the CLI is the easiest way to familiarize yourself with
how TUF works, however.  It will serve as a very basic update system.

----

**Step (0)** - Make sure TUF is installed.

Make sure that TUF is installed, along with some of the optional cryptographic
libraries and C extensions.  Try this command to do that:
`python3 -m pip install securesystemslib[colors,crypto,pynacl] tuf`

If you run into errors during that pip command, please consult the more
detailed [TUF Installation Instructions](INSTALLATION.rst).  (There are some
system libraries that you may need to install first.)


**Step (1)** - Create a basic repository and client.

The following command will set up a basic update repository and basic client
that knows about the repository.  `tufrepo`, `tufkeystore`, and
`tufclient` directories will be created in the current directory.

```Bash
$ repo.py --init
```

Four sets of keys are created in the `tufkeystore` directory.  Initial metadata
about the repository is created in the `tufrepo` directory, and also provided
to the client in the `tufclient` directory.


**Step (2)** - Add an update to the repository.

We'll create a target file that will later be delivered as an update to clients.
Metadata about that file will be created and signed, and added to the
repository's metadata.

```Bash
$ echo 'Test file' > testfile
$ repo.py --add testfile
$ tree tufrepo/
tufrepo/
├── metadata
│   ├── 1.root.json
│   ├── root.json
│   ├── snapshot.json
│   ├── targets.json
│   └── timestamp.json
├── metadata.staged
│   ├── 1.root.json
│   ├── root.json
│   ├── snapshot.json
│   ├── targets.json
│   └── timestamp.json
└── targets
    └── testfile

    3 directories, 11 files
```

The new file `testfile` is added to the repository, and metadata is updated in
the `tufrepo` directory.  The Targets metadata (`targets.json`) now includes
the file size and hashes of the `testfile` target file, and this metadata is
signed by the Targets role's key, so that clients can verify that metadata
about `testfile` and then verify `testfile` itself.


**Step (3)** - Serve the repo.

We'll host a toy http server containing the `testfile` update and the
repository's metadata.

```Bash
$ cd "tufrepo/"
$ python3 -m http.server 8001
```

**Step (4)** - Obtain and verify the `testfile` update on a client.

The client can request the package `testfile` from the repository.  TUF will
download and verify metadata from the repository as necessary to determine
what the trustworthy hashes and length of `testfile` are, then download
the target `testfile` from the repository and keep it only if it matches that
trustworthy metadata.

```Bash
$ cd "../tufclient/"
$ client.py --repo http://localhost:8001 testfile
$ tree
.
├── tufrepo
│   └── metadata
│       ├── current
│       │   ├── 1.root.json
│       │   ├── root.json
│       │   ├── snapshot.json
│       │   ├── targets.json
│       │   └── timestamp.json
│       └── previous
│           ├── 1.root.json
│           ├── root.json
│           ├── snapshot.json
│           ├── targets.json
│           └── timestamp.json
└── tuftargets
    └── testfile

    5 directories, 11 files
```

Now that a trustworthy update target has been obtained, an updater can proceed
however it normally would to install or use the update.

### Next Steps

TUF provides functionality for both ends of a software update system, the
**update provider** and the **update client**.

`repo.py` made use of `tuf.repository_tool`'s functionality for an update
provider, helping you produce and sign metadata about your updates.

`client.py` made use of `tuf.client.updater`'s client-side functionality,
performing download and the critical verification steps for metadata and the
update itself.

You can look at [CLI.md](CLI.md) to toy with the TUF CLI a bit more.
After that, try out using the underlying modules for a great deal more control.
The more detailed [Advanced Tutorial](TUTORIAL.md) shows you how to use the
underlying modules, `repository_tool` and `updater`.

Ultimately, a sophisticated update client will use or re-implement those
underlying modules.  The TUF design is intended to play well with any update
workflow.
