# Changelog

## v0.17.0
**NOTE**: this will be the final release of tuf that supports Python 2.7.
This is because Python 2.7 was marked [end-of-life](
https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/) in January of 2020, and
since then several of tuf's direct and transient dependencies have stopped
supporting Python 2.7.

### Added
* Added Architectural Decisions Records (ADRs) for:
  * where to develop python-tuf 1.0 (#1220)
  * to justify the extent of OOP in the metadata model (#1229)

### Changed
* Switch to GitHub Actions for CI (#1242, #1283, #1252)

* Bump dependencies: requests (#1245), chardet (#1239), urllib3 (#1268),
  cffi (#1280), securesystemslib (#1285), cryptography (#1282, #1286).
  **NOTE**: the latest version of cryptography is no longer used on
  Python 2, as that is not supported.
* Moved from dependabot-preview to GitHub native Dependabot (#1258)
* Configure dependabot to ignore idna, as it breaks Python 2.7 builds (#1259)

  urllib (#1212), cffi (#1222), certifi (#1201), securesystemslib (#1191)
* Simplify the test runner (`aggregate_tests`) and stop executing unit test
  modules in a random order (#1187)

* Adapt to securesystemslib changes in key generation interfaces (#1191)
* Migrate from travis-ci.org to travis-ci.com (#1208)
* Make metadata signatures ordered by keyid, to ensure deterministic signature
  ordering in metadata files (#1217)
* Improve test reliability by using thread-safe `Queue`s, rather than files,
  for process communication (#1198)
* Avoid reading an entire target file into memory when generating target file
  hashes in `tuf.client.updater` (#1219)
* Remove use of an empty list (`[]`) as the default argument in a test
  function (#1216)
* Simplified updater logic for downloading and verifying target files (#1202)

### Fixed
* Fix threshold computation in `_verify_root_self_signed()` such that
  signatures by the same root key count only once towards the threshold (#1218)

## v0.15.0
### Added
* Simple TUF role metadata model in the `tuf.api` package for interacting with
  metadata files directly, per-file without the overheads of reading and
  writing the entire repository at once (#1112, #1177, #1183)
* Raise `MissingLocalRepositoryError` in updater when local repository can not
  be found (#1173)

* Bump dependencies: cffi (#1146), cryptography (#1149), urllib (#1179),
  securesystemslib (#1183)
* Overhauled logging to be less verbose and less alarming, by removing logging
  in the library when an exception is raised (including the same information
  that was logged) and using more appropriate log levels (#1145)
* Make test output more useful by reducing and improving logging (#1145, #1104, #1170)

* Fix parameter name in `tuf.repository_lib` error message (#1078)

## v0.14.0
### Added
* Added a mechanism to the Updater to disable the hash prefix for target files
  even when `consistent_snapshot` is enabled for a repository (#1102)

### Changed
* Updater now uses keyids provided in the metadata, rather than re-calculating
  keyids using `keyid_hash_algorithms` (#1014, #1121)
* When loading an existing repository the keyids provided in the metadata will
  be used, rather than re-calculating keyids using `keyid_hash_algorithms` (#1014, #1121)

  use polling to check whether the simple_server is ready to accept
  connections (#1096)

  metadata when those lengths and hashes will be included in the metadata (#1097)
* Re-raise chained exceptions explicitly per PEP 3134 (#1116)

  desired algorithms explicitly to securesystemslib's
  `keys.format_metadata_to_key` (#1016)

  ensuring that a newly downloaded root metadata file is verified with a
  threshold of its own signatures (#1101)

  delegated role (#1037)
